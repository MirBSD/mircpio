.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates, adds files to, or extracts files from an
archive file in
.Dq tar
format.
A tar archive is often stored on a magnetic tape, but can be
stored equally well on a floppy, CD-ROM, or in a regular disk file.
.Pp
In the first (legacy) form, all option flags except for
.Fl C
and
.Fl I
must be contained within the first argument to
.Nm
and must not be prefixed by a hyphen
.Pq Sq \-\& .
Option arguments, if any, are processed as subsequent arguments to
.Nm
and are processed in the order in which their corresponding option
flags have been presented on the command line.
.Pp
In the second and preferred form, option flags may be given in any order
and are immediately followed by their corresponding option argument
values.
.Pp
One of the following flags must be present:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Create new archive, or overwrite an existing archive,
adding the specified files to it.
.It Fl r
Append the named new files to existing archive.
Note that this will only work on media on which an end-of-file mark
can be overwritten.
.It Fl t
List contents of archive.
If any files are named on the
command line, only those files will be listed.
The
.Ar file
arguments may be specified as glob patterns (see
.Xr glob 7
for more information), in which case
.Nm
will list all archive members that match each pattern.
.It Fl u
Alias for
.Fl r .
.It Fl x
Extract files from archive.
If any files are named on the
command line, only those files will be extracted from the
archive.
The
.Ar file
arguments may be specified as glob patterns (see
.Xr glob 7
for more information), in which case
.Nm
will extract all archive members that match each pattern.
.Pp
If more than one copy of a file exists in the
archive, later copies will overwrite earlier copies during
extraction.
The file mode and modification time are preserved
if possible.
The file mode is subject to modification by the
.Xr umask 2 .
.El
.Pp
In addition to the flags mentioned above, any of the following
flags may be used:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Write Unix Archiver libraries instead of tape archives.
.It Fl a
Guess the compression utility based on the archive filename.
Inability to guess will result in quietly not using any compression.
This option only exists for semi-compatibility with
.Tn GNU
.Nm tar ;
it is strongly recommended to archive to stdout and pipe into
an external compression utility with appropriate arguments instead:
.Pp
.Dl tar \-cf \- foo \*(Ba xz \-2e \*(Gtfoo.txz
.It Fl b Ar blocking-factor
Set blocking factor to use for the archive.
.Nm
uses 512-byte blocks.
The default is 20, the maximum is 126.
Archives with a blocking factor larger than 63 violate the
.Tn POSIX
standard and will not be portable to all systems.
.It Fl C Ar directory
This is a positional argument which sets the working directory for the
following files.
When extracting, files will be extracted into
the specified directory; when creating, the specified files will be matched
from the directory.
.It Fl e
Stop after the first error.
.It Fl f Ar archive
Filename where the archive is stored.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/rst0 .
If set to hyphen
.Pq Sq \-\&
standard output is used.
See also the
.Ev TAPE
environment variable.
.It Fl H
Follow symlinks given on the command line only.
.It Fl h
Follow symbolic links as if they were normal files
or directories.
In extract mode this means that a directory entry in the archive
will not overwrite an existing symbolic link, but rather what the
link ultimately points to.
.It Fl I Ar file
This is a positional argument which reads the names of files to
archive or extract from the given file, one per line.
.It Fl J
Use the xz utility to compress the archive.
.It Fl j
Use the bzip2 utility to compress the archive.
.It Fl L
Synonym for the
.Fl h
option.
.It Fl M Ar flag
Configure the archive normaliser.
.Ar flag
is either a numeric value compatible to
.Xr strtonum 3
which is directly stored in the flags word, or
one of the following values, optionally prefixed with
.Dq no\-
to turn them off:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -compact
.It Ar inodes
0x0001: Serialise inodes, zero device info.
.br
(cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc)
.It Ar links
0x0002: Store content of hard links only once.
.br
(cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc)
.It Ar mtime
0x0004: Zero out the file modification time.
.br
(ar, cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc, ustar)
.It Ar uidgid
0x0008: Set owner to 0:0
.Pq Li root Ns : Ns Li wheel .
.br
(ar, cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc, ustar)
.It Ar verb
0x0010: Debug this option.
.It Ar debug
0x0020: Debug file header storage.
.It Ar lncp
0x0040: Extract hard links by copy if link fails.
.It Ar numid
0x0080: Use only numeric uid and gid values.
.br
(ustar)
.It Ar gslash
0x0100: Append a slash after directory names.
.br
(ustar)
.It Ar set
0x0003: Keep ownership and mtime intact.
.It Ar dist
0x008B: Clean everything except mtime.
.It Ar norm
0x008F: Clean everything.
.It Ar root
0x0089: Clean owner and device information.
.El
.Pp
When creating an archive and verbosely listing output, these
normalisation operations are not reflected in the output,
because they are made only after the output has been shown.
.Pp
This option is only implemented for the ar, cpio, sv4cpio,
sv4crc, and ustar file format writing routines.
.It Fl m
Do not preserve modification time.
.It Fl N
Same as
.Fl M Ar numid .
.It Fl O
If reading, extract files to standard output.
.br
If writing, write old-style (non-POSIX) archives.
.It Fl o
If writing, write old-style (non-POSIX) archives.
Don't write directory information that the older (V7) style
.Nm tar
is unable to decode.
.It Fl P
For security reasons,
.Nm
skips pathnames containing dotdot
.Pq Dq ..\&
components and strips leading slashes
.Pq Sq /
from pathnames by default; this option disables that behaviour.
.It Fl p
Preserve user and group ID as well as file mode regardless of
the current
.Xr umask 2 .
The setuid and setgid bits are only preserved if the user and group ID
could be preserved.
Only meaningful in conjunction with the
.Fl x
flag.
.It Fl q
Select the first archive member that matches each
.Ar file
operand.
No more than one archive member is matched for each
.Ar file .
When members of type directory are matched, the file hierarchy rooted at that
directory is also matched.
.It Fl s Ar replstr
Modify the archive member names according to the substitution expression
.Ar replstr ,
using the syntax of the
.Xr ed 1
utility regular expressions.
.Ar file
arguments may be given to restrict the list of archive members to those
specified.
.Pp
The format of these regular expressions is
.Pp
.Dl /old/new/[gp]
.Pp
As in
.Xr ed 1 ,
.Va old
is a basic regular expression (see
.Xr re_format 7 )
and
.Va new
can contain an ampersand
.Pq Ql & ,
.Ql \e Ns Em n
(where
.Em n
is a digit) back-references,
or subexpression matching.
The
.Va old
string may also contain newline characters.
Any non-null character can be used as a delimiter
.Po
.Ql /
is shown here
.Pc .
Multiple
.Fl s
expressions can be specified.
The expressions are applied in the order they are specified on the
command line, terminating with the first successful substitution.
.Pp
The optional trailing
.Cm g
continues to apply the substitution expression to the pathname substring,
which starts with the first character following the end of the last successful
substitution.
The first unsuccessful substitution stops the operation of the
.Cm g
option.
The optional trailing
.Cm p
will cause the final result of a successful substitution to be written to
standard error in the following format:
.Pp
.D1 Em original-pathname No \*(Gt\*(Gt Em new-pathname
.Pp
File or archive member names that substitute to the empty string
are not selected and will be skipped.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation mode.
If
.Fl v
is specified multiple times or if the
.Fl t
option is also specified,
.Nm
will use a long format for listing files, similar to
.Xr ls 1
.Fl l .
.It Fl w
Interactively rename files.
This option causes
.Nm
to prompt the user for the filename to use when storing or
extracting files in an archive.
.It Fl X
Do not cross mount points in the filesystem.
.It Fl Z
Use the
.Xr compress 1
utility to compress the archive.
.It Fl z
Use the
.Xr gzip 1
utility to compress the archive.
.El
.Pp
The options
.Op Fl 014578
can be used to select one of the compiled-in backup devices,
.Pa /dev/rstN .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev TMPDIR
Path in which to store temporary files.
.It Ev TAPE
Default tape device to use instead of
.Pa /dev/rst0 .
If set to hyphen
.Pq Sq \-\&
standard output is used.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/rst0"
.It Pa /dev/rst0
default archive name
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0
All files were processed successfully.
.It 1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create an archive on the default tape drive, containing the files named
.Pa bonvole
and
.Pa sekve :
.Pp
.Dl $ \*(nm c bonvole sekve
.Pp
Output a
.Xr gzip 1
compressed archive containing the files
.Pa bonvole
and
.Pa sekve
to a file called
.Pa foriru.tar.gz :
.Pp
.Dl $ \*(nm zcf foriru.tar.gz bonvole sekve
.Pp
Verbosely create an archive, called
.Pa backup.tar.gz ,
of all files matching the shell
.Xr glob 7
function
.Pa *.c :
.Pp
.Dl $ \*(nm zcvf backup.tar.gz *.c
.Pp
Verbosely list, but do not extract, all files ending in
.Pa .jpeg
from a compressed archive named
.Pa backup.tar.gz .
Note that the glob pattern has been quoted to avoid expansion by the shell:
.Pp
.Dl $ \*(nm tvzf backup.tar.gz \*(aq*.jpeg\*(aq
.Pp
For more detailed examples, see
.Xr \*(np 1 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Whenever
.Nm
cannot create a file or a link when extracting an archive or cannot
find a file while writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user
ID, group ID, file mode, or access and modification times when the
.Fl p
option is specified, a diagnostic message is written to standard
error and a non-zero exit value will be returned, but processing
will continue.
In the case where
.Nm
cannot create a link to a file,
unless
.Fl M Ar lncp
is given,
.Nm
will not create a second copy of the file.
.Pp
If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated
by a signal or error,
.Nm
may have only partially extracted the file the user wanted.
Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and directories may
have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times may
be wrong.
.Pp
If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal
or error,
.Nm
may have only partially created the archive, which may violate the
specific archive format specification.

.Sh CAVEATS
The flags
.Fl AaJjLMNo
are not portable to other implementations of
.Nm tar
where they may have a different meaning or not exist at all.
This implementation may have support for other non-standard options that
are undocumented because removal-inducing deprecation was issued.
There is no option to select a different output format from
.Cm ustar
or
.Cm tar
except
.Fl A ,
which selects
.Cm ar ;
use the
.Xr \*(nc 1
or
.Xr \*(np 1
front-ends for that.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Ar pax
file format is not yet supported.
